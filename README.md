# CourtFinder CLI

Transform 300GB freelaw.org bulk court data into accessible, searchable court records through a simple command-line interface.

## Quick Start

```bash
python menu.py
```

That's it! CourtFinder CLI will start automatically with a beautiful interface and test data ready to explore.

## What This Does

CourtFinder CLI solves the critical challenge of accessing and analyzing the massive freelaw.org bulk court data repository. While the complete 300GB dataset contains invaluable legal information, its size and format complexity make it practically unusable for most researchers and developers. Our CLI tool transforms overwhelming bulk data into accessible, searchable court records in just a few clicks.
